# How to host it for free?

- **1.** Make another github account and don't follow anyone and don't fork any repo

> I mean don't tell anyone about your account bcoz you have to upload photos in this repo and for hosting for free on github pages you have to make repo public.

- **2.** Import this repo (Don't fork) and give any random name (give any random name like `uxhevfxueuueude` so that no one can search your repo on github)

-**3.** go to `img` folder of repo and delete photo.png and upload photo and name it `photo.png`

- **4.** Now go to Wish-Her/gallary folder and delete photos named `1.jpg, 2.jpg......6.jpg` and upload your 6 photos and name them `1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg.........6.jpg` 

- **5.** Now go to settings of your repo, find github pages, and enable github pages. After few seconds your page will be live.

#Credits

 I merged two different scripts into one, modified them a little and made guide to host it on github pages. I forgot both of original owners, once i find them i will give proper credits.
